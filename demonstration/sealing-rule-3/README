These three libraries demonstrate rule 3 of the sealing rules as specified in the DRM.

<put real explanation here>

to compile:

pushd a; make; popd;
pushd b; make; popd;
pushd c; make; popd;

If compiling C fails, the dylan compiler correctly enforces rule 3.
If it compiles and runs, the compiler does not enforce rule 3.
