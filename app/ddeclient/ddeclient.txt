DDECLIENT
---------

This small program uses the Win32 DDEML library to send a command to a
DDE server.  In particular, it sends a single Execute (XTYP_EXECUTE)
transaction to a given service name, under a given topic.

The command format is:

  ddeclient <service> <topic> <command-string> ...

All arguments are required and there must be at least one
<command-string>.  If there are several, they will be concatentated
_without_ spaces, as appears to be the norm.  If you need to include
spaces between commands, enclose the whole lot in quotes.  The format
of the command string will depend on the DDE service.
