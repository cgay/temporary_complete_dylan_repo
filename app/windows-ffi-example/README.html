<H2>Windows FFI Example Project</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains a simple example program that
demonstrates how a Microsoft Windows application can be written
in Dylan by using the Dylan libraries that provide a Foreign
Function Interface to the Windows API.

<P>Note that because this example contains resources it requires
the Windows resource compiler, rc.exe and associated files, in
order to compile successfully.  The resource compiler is
available for download from the Microsoft website as part of the
"Microsoft Platform SDK build environment".  At the time of this
writing the URL is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/sdktools.asp">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/developer/sdk/sdktools.asp</a>.</P>

<P>The entire program is in the file "example.dylan", but it also
uses a few additional files for defining resources used.  The
program simply displays a window that includes examples of
drawing text, shapes, and lines, and has a menu bar from which an
"About" box can be displayed from the "Help" menu and the program
can be exited from the "File" menu. While the program doesn't do
much, it does illustrate the essential structure of a Windows
program and should be useful as a starting point for writing real
applications.</P>

<P>Note that many of the menu items are not intended to work; they are
just there for illustrative purposes.  In particular, the "Contents"
and "Search for Help On..." menu items invoke the standard Windows
Help facility (WinHelp) to look for a file called EXAMPLE.HLP which
is not provided with the example.</P>
