<H2>Interface Builder Example Project</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This is a very simple interface builder for DUIM that can be
used to build up a top-level DUIM window (a frame) and then
generate code for it which can then be compiled and run, or
modified by hand.</P>

<P>This is not intended to be a real GUI builder by any stretch
of the imagination, but it will hopefully be useful as a learning
tool. It is a work in progress.</P>

<H2>Tutorial</H2>

<P>To build an interface, use the menu item <B>File &gt; New</B> to
create a new interface and then use the <B>Edit &gt; Add...</B>  and
<B>Edit &gt; Remove...</B> menu items to add and remove items from the
interface. As you build your interface you will see the hierarchy
of UI elements displayed in the main window and the interface
itself will be displayed in its own window so you can see what
you've built so far.</P>

<P>Note that the Add/Remove commands always operate on the
selected item in the hierarchy window. Be sure to select the
correct item before using one of the commands. Note that the Add
command only makes sense for UI elements that can have children,
such as layouts or frames, so if you select (for example) a push
button, the Add command will be disabled.</P>

<P>As a first attempt, try the following sequence:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Select <B>File &gt; New</B>
	<LI>Select <B>Edit &gt; Add...</B> and choose <B>Column Layout</B>
	<LI>Select <B>column-layout</B> in the hierarchy window and add a <B>Text Field</B>.
	<LI>Select <B>column-layout</B> again and add another <B>Text Field</B>.
	<LI>Select <B>column-layout</B> and add a <B>Row Layout</B>.
	<LI>Select <B>row-layout</B> and add a <B>Push Button</B>.
	<LI>Select <B>row-layout</B> and add a <B>Push Button</B>.
	<LI>You should now have a frame that looks like this:
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="my-frame.gif" WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="107" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
	<P></P>
	<LI>Select <B>File > Save</B> to generate Dylan code for this interface.

</OL>

<P>The resulting code looks like this:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
Module: my-module

define frame &lt;my-frame&gt; (&lt;simple-frame&gt;)
  pane text-field-1 (frame)
    make(&lt;text-field&gt;);
  pane text-field-2 (frame)
    make(&lt;text-field&gt;);
  pane push-button-1 (frame)
    make(&lt;push-button&gt;);
  pane push-button-2 (frame)
    make(&lt;push-button&gt;);
  layout (frame)
    vertically ()
      frame.text-field-1;
      frame.text-field-2;
      horizontally ()
        frame.push-button-1;
        frame.push-button-2;
      end;
    end;
  keyword title: = "My Frame";
end frame &lt;my-frame&gt;;
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Notice that each visible UI element corresponds to a
<code>pane</code> clause in the <code>define frame</code> form.
There is one <code>layout</code> clause which defines how the
panes are arranged on screen.  The <code>column-layout</code> and
<code>row-layout</code> were converted into calls to the
<code>vertically</code> and <code>horizontally</code> macros,
respectively.</P>

<P>To see how the code looks when run, you can cut-and-paste it
into the Dylan Playground and then use the following expression
to start it:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
start-frame(make(&lt;my-frame&gt;));
