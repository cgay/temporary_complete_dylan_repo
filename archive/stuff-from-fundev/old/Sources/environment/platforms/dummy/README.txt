Synopsis:  Description of purpose of dummy editor-manager library

This dummy library is only here so that I [hughg] can check in my
"real" editor interface without having a working implementation for
every platform.  The "editor-manager" library is currently used by
the "environment-tools" library, which is needed for a working
environment on each platform, as I understand it.
