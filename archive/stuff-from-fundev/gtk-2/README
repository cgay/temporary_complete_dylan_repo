To generate the Dylan source code for the GTK+ 2.0 bindings,
just type `make'.

Many of the C header files have been modified slightly in
order for the Gema script (`patterns.gema') to be able to
process them.  The ideal solution would be to fix the Gema
script instead of messing with the upstream headers; indeed,
I have already done so to a large extent, but for these last
few cases either I did not know how to fix the script, or I
decided that it would be too hard to be worth the trouble.

The upshot of this is that whenever we upgrade to a newer
upstream version of one of the libraries it is necessary to
perform a three-way merge of the header files.  To do this,
the upstream changes to the header files should be checked
into a branch in the version control system.  The tip of
this branch should then be merged into the trunk.
