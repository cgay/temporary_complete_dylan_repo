<P>The classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle

<P>Given three pegs with N rings of increasing size on one peg, the
program must transfer all the rings to another peg.

<P>The rules are: transfer only one ring at a time and never put a
larger ring on top of a smaller one.

<P>The correct strategy will require 2^n - 1 moves to transfer N
disks. According to folklore, starting with 52 rings and transferring
one ring per second, when the last ring is moved, the world will end.
