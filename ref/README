This directory contains files documenting CMU's Gwydion Dylan 2.0. This is
very much a work in progress. To make the HTML versions, you'll need to
install the Cygnus DocBook tools.

For more information, contact eric.kidd@pobox.com.

These files are copyright on various dates by various people. It would
probably be unwise to copy them without talking to me first. We'll sort out
the licensing soon and put everything under a suitable free license.
