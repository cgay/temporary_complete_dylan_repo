  abstract = {
    A generic function is similar to an overloaded operator, but provides a
    way to select an appropriate behavior at run-time instead of compile-time.
    Dujardin and colleagues have proposed an algorithm for building and
    compressing generic function dispatch tables.

    We present several modifications to their algorithm, including an
    improvement to Pseudo-Closest-Poles and two new algorithms for compressing
    pole tables.  The two new compression algorithms are simple and fast, and
    one produces smaller output than the original.
