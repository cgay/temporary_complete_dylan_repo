Conditional compilation features that might be present when compiling
with Gwydion compilers (ie, Mindy or d2c):

mindy
	Defined when compiling with mindycomp.  There is currently no
	feature for d2c; most of our code assumes that anything that
	isn't mindy is d2c.

compiled-for-hppa-hpux
	Defined when compiling for an HP/UX system running on
	HP-PARISC hardware.

compiled-for-x86-win32
	Defined when compiling for an Intel- or Intel-clone-based
	computer running a Microsoft Win32 operating system (ie,
	Windows '95 or Windows/NT).

newlines-are-CRLF
	Defined when compiling for a system whose newline
	representation is two bytes, a carriage return ('\r')
	followed by a linefeed ('\f').  Examples of such systems
	include MS-DOS, Windows '95, Windows/NT, and OS/2.  It should
	be kept in mind that not every file on a newlines-are-CRLF
	system will adhere to this convention; some will adhere to
	the Unix convention of using a single linefeed as the newline
	character.  For this reason, programs should consider the
	carriage return an optional part of the newline sequence.

C-compiler-is-GCC
	Defined when compiling with d2c and the C compiler being used
	by d2c is the GNU C compiler (gcc).

C-compiler-is-VC
	Defined when compiling with d2c and the C compiler being used
	by d2c is Microsoft Visual C++.


Placeholder features: These features are never defined because we
haven't yet implemented the things that these features represent.
Currently the only placeholder feature is threads.

threads
	Will be defined whenever multi-threading is a possibility.
	Users who are writing threadsafe code but are worried about
	efficiency can generate a threadsafe and a non-threadsafe
	version of their code by conditionalizing things on this
	feature.
