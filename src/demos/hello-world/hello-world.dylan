// This is the canonical ``hello, world'' demo.
//
// Mindy invokes the generic function main with the command line arguments
// as strings.  Given that we don't care what they are, we just ignore them.
//
// We just put this in the Dylan-User module, because there is no reason to
// define out own module for something this simplistic.
