This file contains instructions for building Mindy under Windows/NT
using Visual C++ version 2.0.

Build a copy of Mindy for the HP.

Create a tar file:
 (cd /afs/cs/project/gwydion/mindy/src; tar -cvf ~/mindy.tar `find . -print`)

Pack up the makefiles from the HP:
 (cd /afs/cs/project/gwydion/mindy/build/hp700_ux90;
  tar -cvf ~/makefiles.tar `find . -name Makefile -print`)

On the PC, create a directory for Mindy and change dir to it. Unpack
mindy.tar and makefiles.tar.

Create two directories under the top level Mindy directory, Debug and
Released.  Create Debug/objects and Released/objects.

Place Mindy.mak in the top-level of said directory hierarchy.  Open
with Visual C++.

Due to a bug in Visual C++ 2.0, you'll have to edit some preprocessor
definitions.  Go into the C/C++ pane of the Project/Settings dialog box
and fix the preprocessor definitions for each of the four targets.  In
the little window at the bottom, manually remove

  /D /D /D VERSION=... BINDIR=... LIBDIR=...

from the compiler options.  (You'll have to do this four times, once
for each of the targets)  Then, in the preprocessor definitions
area, add VERSION=..., BINDIR=..., and LIBDIR=... to the definitions.
The values you should use for debugging is

  , VERSION="\"1.3\"", BINDIR="\"d:/mindy-13/bin\"", LIBDIR="\"d:/mindy-13/lib\""

For the release version, use

  , VERSION="\"1.3\"", BINDIR="\"c:/mindy-13/bin\"", LIBDIR="\"c:/mindy-13/lib\""
                              ^                            ^
(It is important to delete the junk in the window before adding the
new definitions)

Now, hit Rebuild All (again, you'll have to do it once for each
target).

Type finish-build to build the libraries.

If you have to modify any of the source files, you'll likely have to
set the write permissions on them:  Go to the file manager, select the
source files, hit Alt-Enter, and clear the Read Only bit.
