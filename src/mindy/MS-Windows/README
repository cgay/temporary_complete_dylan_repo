WinMindy runs under Windows '95 and under Windows/NT v. 3.5 or later.
It requires a file system that supports long file names.  WinMindy
requires tar and GNU Zip (gzip) to unpackage.  To run tar you will
need tar.exe and win32gnu.dll.  To run gzip, get gnubin.tar and use
tar.exe to unpackage it.  Install the GNU utilities contained in
gnubin.tar (gzip is one of these utilities).  You can find all of
these files in the same directory you found WinMindy.tar.gz

To install Mindy, unzip the release, change directory to where you
want to install Mindy, and untar it.  This will create a directory
called "WinMindy".  In order to run Mindy, you will need to set the
MINDYPATH environment variable to point to the mindyNT\lib directory.
You may also want to put the WinMindy\bin directory in your PATH.  For
example, if WinMindy.tar.gz is currently in c:\users\fred, and you want
to install it to c:\stuff\mindy-1.3, type the following:

	c:
	cd \users\fred
	gzip -d WinMindy.tar.gz
	cd \stuff
	tar -xvf \users\fred\WinMindy.tar
	set MINDYPATH=c:\stuff\WinMindy\lib
	set PATH=%PATH%;c:\stuff\WinMindy\bin


WinMindy comes compiled, but if you want to recompile it, you will
need Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0.

To recompile Mindy, follow these steps:
	- Fire up Visual C++ by double-clicking on Mindy.mak under the
	  file manager.
	- Optionally, you can edit interp/mindy.h and change the value
	  of LIBDIR to indicate where Mindy should look for library
	  files.  If you edit this, you will not have to set the
	  MINDYPATH environment variable.  BINDIR does nothing useful
	  in the Windows version of Mindy, so leave it alone.
	- Select Batch Build under Project.  Check "Compiler Release"
	  and "Interpreter Release".  Select Build.
	- Go back to the command prompt.  Build the libraries by
	  typing

		finish-build "MC=mindydir\Released\mindycomp.exe"

	  where mindydir is the directory you're current in.
	- Install the libraries by typing

		finish-build "INSTALL=copy" "INSTALL_DATA=copy" 
			"LIBDIR=whatever" install

	  (all one line)  You'll need to specify LIBDIR even if you
	  provided it to Visual C++.
	- Install the binaries by typing

		copy Released\mindy.exe bin
		copy Released\mindycomp.exe bin

If you have to modify any of the source files, you'll likely have to
set the write permissions on them:  Go to the file manager, select the
source files, hit Alt-Enter, and clear the Read Only bit.
