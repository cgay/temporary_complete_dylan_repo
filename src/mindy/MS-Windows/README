WinMindy runs under Windows '95 and under Windows/NT v. 3.5 or later.
It requires a file system that supports long file names.  WinMindy
requires unzip.exe, which can be found in the same directory as
WinMindy.zip.  (This is the Info-ZIP extractor.  WinZip 6.1 will also
work.  PkZip will *not* work, because it doesn't do long file names)

To install Mindy, change directory to where you want to install Mindy
and unzip it.  This will create a directory called "WinMindy".  In
order to run Mindy, you will need to set the MINDYPATH environment
variable to point to the mindyNT\lib directory.  You may also want to
put the WinMindy\bin directory in your PATH.  For example, if
WinMindy.zip is currently in c:\users\fred, and you want to install
it to c:\stuff, type the following:

	c:
	cd \stuff
	unzip c:\users\fred\WinMindy.zip
	set MINDYPATH=c:\stuff\WinMindy\lib
	set PATH=%PATH%;c:\stuff\WinMindy\bin


WinMindy comes compiled, but if you want to recompile it, you will
need Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.0, Perl, and a "tr" utility
(something that works like the Unix command tr).

To recompile Mindy, follow these steps:
	- Fire up Visual C++ by double-clicking on Mindy.mak under the
	  file manager.
	- Optionally, you can edit interp/mindy.h and change the value
	  of LIBDIR to indicate where Mindy should look for library
	  files.  If you edit this, you will not have to set the
	  MINDYPATH environment variable.  BINDIR does nothing useful
	  in the Windows version of Mindy, so leave it alone.
	- Select Batch Build under Project.  Check "Compiler Release"
	  and "Interpreter Release".  Select Build.
	- Go back to the command prompt.  Build the libraries by
	  typing

		finish-build "MC=mindydir\Released\mindycomp.exe"

	  where mindydir is the directory you're current in.
	- Install the libraries by typing

		finish-build "INSTALL=copy" "INSTALL_DATA=copy" 
			"LIBDIR=whatever" install

	  (all one line)  You'll need to specify LIBDIR even if you
	  provided it to Visual C++.
	- Install the binaries by typing

		copy Released\mindy.exe bin
		copy Released\mindycomp.exe bin

If you have to modify any of the source files, you'll likely have to
set the write permissions on them:  Go to the file manager, select the
source files, hit Alt-Enter, and clear the Read Only bit.
