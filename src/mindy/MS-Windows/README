This file contains instructions for building Mindy under Windows/NT
using Visual C++ version 2.0.

Execute d:\users\default\login.bat to set up your paths.

Get a copy of the Unix release as well as nt-supplement-version.tar.

Unpack the unix release and the supplement:
	gzip -d mindy-1.3.tar.gz
	tar -xvf mindy-1.3.tar
	cd mindy-1.3
	tar -xvf ../nt-supplement-1.3.tar

(note that the supplement assumes the current directory is the root of
the distribution, and not one directory above it)

Run prepare-for-vc.bat

Fire up Visual C++.  Due to a bug in Visual C++ 2.0, you'll have to
edit some preprocessor definitions.  Go into the C/C++ pane of the
Project/Settings dialog box and fix the preprocessor definitions for
each of the Release targets.  In the little window at the bottom,
manually remove

  /D /D /D VERSION=... BINDIR=... LIBDIR=...

from the compiler options.  (You'll have to do this four times, once
for each of the targets)  Then, in the preprocessor definitions
area, add VERSION=..., BINDIR=..., and LIBDIR=... to the definitions.
The values you should use are

  , VERSION="\"1.3\"", BINDIR="\"d:/mindy-13/bin\"", LIBDIR="\"d:/mindy-13/lib\""

Select Batch Build under Project.  Check "Compiler Release" and "Interpreter Release".  Select Rebuild All.

Go back to the command prompt.  Build the libraries by typing
	finish-build MC=pathname\Released\mindycomp.exe

If you have to modify any of the source files, you'll likely have to
set the write permissions on them:  Go to the file manager, select the
source files, hit Alt-Enter, and clear the Read Only bit.
