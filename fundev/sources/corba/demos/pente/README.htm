This is an adaptation of the Pente game to run in a distributed way
using CORBA. Two players each run Pente on their computers and
play against each other.

<P>The program is composed of the following parts:

<DL>
  <DT><EM>library.dylan</EM>
    <DD>Dylan library definition
  <DT><EM>module.dylan</EM>
    <DD>Dylan module definition
  <DT><EM>board.dylan</EM>
    <DD>Dylan implementation of Pente game and distribution
  <DT><EM>start.dylan</EM>
    <DD>Dylan entry point
  <DT><EM>pente.spec</EM>
    <DD>configuration file for IDL
  <DT><EM>pente.idl</EM>
    <DD>the IDL file itself
  <DT><EM>README.htm</EM>

<H2>Building and Testing the Application</H2>

Just press the "Build" button on the Project Window.

<P>After it has finished building press the "Build Release" menu item
on the Project menu of the Project window to create a redistributable
executable and DLLs for the other player.

<P>Get the other player to copy the "Release" directory to his
computer.

<P>Now, you can run the application to test that it works. 

<UL>
<LI>Both players should start up their copies of corba-pente. 

<LI>When both copies are running, one player should press "New Game"
and enter the hostname of the other player's computer. This initiates
the connection.

<LI>Now the player who pressed "New Game" plays first. Try to get 5
stones in a continuous line, or try to surround and capture your
opponent's pairs of stones 5 times.
</UL>

<P>At the end of the game, either player can press "New Game" and go
first for the next game.
