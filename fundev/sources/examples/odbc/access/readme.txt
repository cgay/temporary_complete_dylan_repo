Some of the ODBC examples in sibling directories require the "Northwind"
sample database distributed with MicroSoft Access (although they could
easily be written to use another database).  However, that isn't freely
redistributable, as far as I can tell, so it's not here.

To get at Access databases via ODBC, you'll need to install the latest
version of Microsoft's driver, wihch is part of some "Universal Data Access"
package.  For Win95 and NT4 (as at 1998/10/16) this can be obtained from the
Web at

where the file "mdacfull.exe" is all you need.
