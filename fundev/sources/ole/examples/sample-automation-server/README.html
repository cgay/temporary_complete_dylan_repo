<H2>Sample-automation-server library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that is a demonstration of
a simple OLE Automation server in Dylan. It uses the utility functions
of the Dylan <b>OLE-Automation</b> library rather than the low-level
Windows OLE API.  The program responds to commands issued by the companion
program in the project <b>sample-automation-controller</b>.</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-Automation</b> library is documented in the Functional Developer
"OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<P>This program by itself doesn't do anything except put an empty window
up on the screen.  All drawing in the window is done in response to
commands issued from the <b>sample-automation-controller</b> program.</P>

<P>The definition of <code>&lt;painter&gt;</code> at the top of the
file <em>drawing.dylan</em> specifies the functions and properties
that are made available for a controller to use.  The only thing the
controller needs to know is the class ID and the names of the members.
The class <code>&lt;painter&gt;</code> is the IDispatch object that
the controller will be interacting with.</P>

<H3>Server registration and invocation</H3>

<P>This project can be built in either of two configurations.  It can
be built as an EXE file which can then be used as a local server, or
it can be built as a DLL file which can then be used as an in-process
server.  The default is to build an EXE file.  Use the "Target file"
entry in the "Link" tab of the "Project &gt; Settings..." dialog to
switch between these two options.</P>

<P>The easiest way to use a local (EXE) server is to just start it first, and
then start the controller program.  It is also possible to just start a
controller and let it start the server, but that requires registering the
server first.  If you are using the in-process (DLL) server configuration, you
have no choice but to register the server and let the controller start it.
</P>

<P>In either case, in order for the server to work when started from
a client program, all of the libraries used by your server need to either
be in the same directory as the server file, or else in a directory which is
in the system PATH (not the individual user's PATH on NT). The simplest way to
accomplish this is to use the "Project &gt; Build Release" command to create a
release directory. If you wish, you can move that directory to any location you
want, but you must do so before you attempt to register the server.
</P>

<P>To register the local server, run it from a DOS command prompt like this:<P>

  <blockquote><code>sample-automation-server.exe /regserver</code></blockquote>

<P>This will create the necessary entries in the Windows System Registry and
then terminate without creating any windows. The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:
  <blockquote><code>sample-automation-server.exe /unregserver</code></blockquote>

<P>To register an in-process server, use the <code>regsvr32</code> command
line utility like this:</P>

 <blockquote><code>regsvr32 sample-automation-server.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>(The complete pathname will need to be given if the file is in a
different directory that is not in the PATH.)  This will cause the
appropriate entries to be made in the Windows System Registry. (For
use in a batch script, the "<code>/s</code>" option may be used to suppress the
dialog box reporting completion.) The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:</P>

 <blockquote><code>regsvr32 /u sample-automation-server.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>This invokes the server to unregister itself, so won't work
if the server has been deleted first.</P>


<P>After registering the server, you can run the
<b>sample-automation-controller</b> example program to test it.</P>
