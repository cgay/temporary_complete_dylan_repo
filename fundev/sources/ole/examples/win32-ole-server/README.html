<H2>win32-ole-server library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">


<P>This project contains an example program which demonstrates the
use of the <b>OLE-Server</b> library to create a graphical object
that can be embedded in compound documents.</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-Server</b> library is documented in the Functional Developer
"OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<P>This example provides the same functionality as the C++ program in
directory "\MSTOOLS\samples\ole\simpsvr\" from the Microsoft Win32 SDK
of July 1995. The "README.TXT" file there describes it as: </P>

 <BLOCKQUOTE>
 This sample is the simplest OLE 2.0 object that can be
 written and still support the visual editing feature. The object that
 this server supports is a colored square with a black
 border.
 </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The direct translation of the C++ program into Dylan is available
as the example called <b>sample-ole-server</b> under the "Low-level
OLE" examples. The version in this project is written in a more
natural Dylan style than <b>sample-ole-server</b> and uses the server
framework provided by the <b>OLE-server</b> library to greatly
simplify the program.</P>

<H3>Project configuration</H3>

<P>This project can be built in either of two configurations. It can
be built as an EXE file which can then be used as a local server, or
it can be built as a DLL file which can then be used as an in-process
server. The default is to build an EXE file. Use the "Target file"
entry in the "Link" tab of the "Project &gt; Settings..." dialog to
switch between these two options.</P>

<P>In either case, in order for the server to work when invoked from a client
program, all of the libraries used by your server need to either be in the
same directory as the server file, or else in a directory which is in the
system PATH (not the individual user's PATH on NT). The simplest way to
accomplish this is to use the "Project &gt; Build Release" command to create a
release directory. If you wish, you can move that directory to any location
you want, but you must do so before you attempt to register the server.
</P>

<H3>Local server (EXE) registration</H3>

<P>After the project has been built, you will have a program
which you can execute.  By itself, it doesn't do much very interesting
-- just draws a square whose color you can select from a menu.</P>

<P>The really interesting thing is using the program as an embedded
object. To do that, you must first register it with the operating system.
You can do this by running the program (from the release directory) from
a DOS command prompt like this:</P>

    <blockquote><code>win32-ole-server.exe /regserver</code></blockquote>

<P>This will create the necessary entries in the Windows System Registry and
then terminate without creating any windows. The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:
  <blockquote><code>sample-automation-server.exe /unregserver</code></blockquote>

<P>The server is registered with the title "Dylan simple local OLE
Server" which comes from from the call to
<CODE>register-ole-server</CODE> in <em>appexe.dylan</em>.</P>

<H3>In-process server (DLL) registration</H3>

<P>To register an in-process server, use the <code>regsvr32</code> command line
utility like this:</P>

  <blockquote><code>regsvr32 win32-ole-server.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>(The complete pathname will need to be given if the file is in a
different directory that is not in the PATH.)  This will cause the
appropriate entries to be made in the Windows System Registry. (For
use in a batch script, the "<code>/s</code>" option may be used to suppress the
dialog box reporting completion.) The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>regsvr32 /u win32-ole-server.dll</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This invokes the server to unregister itself, so won't work
if the server has been deleted first.</P>

<P>The server is registered with the title "Dylan simple in-process OLE
Server" which comes from from the call to
<CODE>initialize-ole-server</CODE> in <em>appdll.dylan</em>. The EXE and DLL
versions have different class ID numbers so that they can both be
installed at the same time.</P>

<H3>Program execution</H3>

<P>You can use any OLE container program, such as Microsoft Word or
WordPad, or the sample container application <code>simpcntr</code> in
the SDK (or its Dylan equivalent in the
<code>sample-ole-container</code> example), to choose the server from
the "Insert Object" command of the "Edit" menu or, for Word or
WordPad, the "Object..." command of the "Insert" menu. The program
will then be invoked to draw its picture which will then appear in the
compound document.</P>

<P>Most containers use in-place activation, in which the picture is
drawn directly in the window of the container program, and the menu
for changing the color is added to the container's menu bar. Clicking
once outside the picture de-activates it, and double-clicking on the
picture re-activates it.</P>

<P>A local server can also be activated out-of-place, running in its
own top-level window while active, and the picture will be copied into
the document when the window is closed. To do this from Word or
WordPad, select the drawing (by clicking once while not active) and
then invoke the menu item "Edit" &gt; "Dylan OLE Server Object" &gt;
"Open". </P>

<H3>Program internals</H3>

<P>The program consists of the following files:</P>

<dl>
  <dt> <em>library.dylan</em>
    <dd> The library and module definitions for this project.

  <dt> <em>app.dylan</em>
    <dd> The application class <code>&lt;simple-server-app&gt;</code> and
    application methods.  This manages the application and document windows.

  <dt> <em>appobj.dylan</em>
    <dd> The OLE object class <code>&lt;simple-server&gt;</code> and OLE
    server methods.  This implements the OLE-specific functionality.  The
    actual drawing of the picture is done by
    <code>ole-part-draw</code>.  Persistence is implemented by
    <code>ole-part-save-to-storage</code> and
    <code>ole-part-load-from-storage</code>.  Server menu installation is done
    in <code>ole-part-insert-menus</code>.
    
  <dt> <em>program.dylan</em>
    <dd> The callback procedures for handling window events.

  <dt> <em>appdll.dylan</em>
    <dd> In-process server support: The macro <code>initialize-ole-server
    </code> is used to declare the information needed for registering the
    server and automatically creating a class factory when requested by a
    client. There is no event loop in this case because that will be provided
    by the client (container) program. The main window is created in the
    server's <CODE>initialize</CODE> method, which will be called when/if
    server creation is requested by the container.

  <dt> <em>appexe.dylan</em>

    <dd> Local server support.  The function <code>main-program</code> is
    invoked to start the program.  If invoked in the in-process case, it does
    nothing, as explained above.  If invoked for self-registration, it
    registers and returns.  If invoked as a server, it creates a class factory
    object, which the container application will use to request creation of
    server objects.  The program then enters a Windows event loop.
