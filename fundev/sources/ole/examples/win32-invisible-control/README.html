<H2>win32-invisible-control library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that demonstrates use of the
<b>OLE-control-framework</b> library to create an invisible OLE Control (also
known as an ActiveX Control).  An invisible control is one that is
displayed as an icon during form design time, through which its properties
can be examined and set.  When the program is run, it does not have any
visual representation or user interface, but it is available to perform
some service through its <code>IDispatch</code> interface(s).</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-control-framework</b> library is documented in the
Functional Developer "OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>


<P>The program consists of the following source files:</P>

<dl>
  <dt><em>library.dylan</em>
    <dd> Library and module definitions.
  <dt><em>windows.dylan</em>
     <dd>Window management.
  <dt><em>control.dylan</em>
     <dd>The OLE Control object class and methods.
</dl>

<P>The macro call <code>initialize-ole-server</code> at the end of the file
<em>control.dylan</em> provides the information needed for registering the
server and automatically creating a class factory when requested by a client.
Note that it is the flag <code>$OLEMISC-INVISIBLEATRUNTIME</code> that causes
this to be an "invisible at runtime" control; it just tells the container to
not display it.  The program's windows are created in the object's
<code>initialize</code> method and destroyed in the <code>terminate</code>
method which will be called when the client releases the server.  There is
both a main window and a "document" window; the main window is never actually
shown, but it needs to exist to serve as a foster parent for the document
window.  The document window is the image that will be displayed at design
time.</P>

<P>In order for the control to work when invoked from a client program, all of
the libraries used by your control need to either be in the same directory as
the server file, or else in a directory which is in the system PATH (not the
individual user's PATH on NT). The simplest way to accomplish this is to use
the "Project &gt; Build Release" command to create a release directory. If you
wish, you can move that directory to any location you want, but you must do so
before you attempt to register the control.  </P>

<P>To register the control, use the <code>regsvr32</code> command line
utility like this:</P>

  <blockquote><code>regsvr32 win32-invisible-control.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>(The complete pathname will need to be given if the file is in a
different directory that is not in the PATH.)  This will cause the
appropriate entries to be made in the Windows System Registry. (For
use in a batch script, the "<code>/s</code>" option may be used to suppress the
dialog box reporting completion.) The full pathname of the control
is recorded, so you must unregister the control before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>regsvr32 /u win32-ole-server.dll</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This invokes the server to unregister itself, so won't work
if the server has been deleted first.</P>

<P>To use this control from Visual Basic 5.0, in the VB "Project" menu (or
from a right-click on the tool palette), invoke "Components".  In the
"Controls" tab, look for the line that says "Dylan invisible-at-runtime
control example".  (Note that this comes from the <code>documentation</code>
option of the <code>define coclass</code> form in <em>control.dylan</em>.)
Click the check box to select it, the press the "OK" button.  An icon
representing the control is added to the tool palette.  Its tool tip name is
"InvisCtl", which comes from the "name" option of the coclass.  Double click
on the icon to insert the control into the current form.  When the icon in the
form is selected, its property values can be examined and modified, and the
new values will be saved as part of the Visual Basic program.  This example
has no direct user interface, even at design time.<P>

<P>This example program really doesn't do anything; it is just a skeleton that
you can extend to create a useful application.  Note that the class
<code>&lt;my-dispinterface&gt;</code> defines an IDispatch interface that will
provide some service to the client.  Here it is shown with two properties
(called <code>dummy-integer-property</code> and
<code>dummy-string-property</code>) and one function (called
<code>dummy-function</code>) which don't really do anything; they just serve
to illustrate how properties and methods are defined and how the values of
properties can be made persistent as part of the client application's data.</P>

<P>So to extend this example into a real application, some of the things you
would want to do are:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>Change the library and module names.</LI>

 <LI>In file <em>control.dylan</em>, replace the interface ID and class ID
   (in the two <code>uuid</code> clauses) with your own ID values, which you
    can get from the <code>create-id</code> utility.</LI>

 <LI>Change the documentation, prog-id and title strings in the <code>define
   coclass</code> and <code>initialize-ole-control</code> forms.  You will
   probably want to add <code>name</code> and <code>documentation</code>
   clauses to the <code>define dispatch-interface</code> form.</LI>

 <LI>Replace the <code>dummy-...</code> dispatch members with whatever you
   need to implement your application.</LI>

 <LI>Adjust the design-time visual representation as desired.  In file
   <em>windows.dylan</em>, see function <code>draw-image</code> and related
   constants <code>$image-width</code>, <code>$image-height</code>,
   and <code>$caption-message</code>.</LI>

 <LI>You could optionally add a resource file to the project that specifies
   an icon which will be shown in the Visual Basic tool bar.</LI>
