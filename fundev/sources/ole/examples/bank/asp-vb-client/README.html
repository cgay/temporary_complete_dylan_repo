<H2>OLE Bank ASP VB Client</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This directory contains an Active Server Pages script that
provides a Web-based client interface to the
 <A HREF="../Server/README.html">Dylan Bank Server</A> in a Web context.
The script is written in VBScript and demonstrates the use of
the dispatch interface facet of the Bank's dual interface to
provide interoperability with Visual Basic.
See the <A HREF="../Client/README.html">Dylan Client</A> for a use
of the customer interface facet of the Bank's dual interface.
See the <A HREF="../../ASP-view/README.html">ASP-View example</A> for an
example of Dylan interoperability with Active Server Pages.</P>

<H3>Web Server configuration</H3>

<P>In order to use this example, you must have a Web server that supports
Active Server Pages, such as described
 <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/default.asp">Windows NT Internet
Information Server (IIS)</A>, or a <A
HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/officedev/office/html/settinguppersonalwebserver.htm">Microsoft
personal Web server</A>.  Make sure to install the Active Server Pages
component of the Web server by downloading any additional Setup programs
needed.</P>

<P>Once you have a Web server installed, copy the file
<em>vb-bank-client.asp</em> from this directory to a directory used by the
server (e.g. to <em>c:\inetpub\wwwroot</em> or <em>c:\wwwroot\</em>).</P>

<H3>Bank Server installation</H3>

<P>In order to use this example, you must install the Bank Server as described
in its <A HREF="../Server/README.html">README</A> file.  Note that
if your Web server is on a different machine than the Bank Server project,
you must copy the release directory to the Web server's machine and register
it there, since this is a server-side component.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>To test out the component, use any browser to connect to your Web server,
and ask it to load the <em>vb-bank-client.asp</em> file.  E.g. if you installed
<em>vb-bank-client.asp</em> in the server's top-level <em>wwwroot</em>
directory, and the browser is running on the same host as the server, the url
would look like this:<br>
<blockquote> <code>http://localserver/vb-bank-client.asp</code>
</blockquote>

<P>The resulting page will give you the option of retrieving information
about an existing account or opening a new account.  Once you have retrieved
or opened some accounts, you can debit or credit them.  The commands you
give in your Web browser are transmitted to the Bank Server located
on the server machine, which then in turn updates the master database.
</P>
