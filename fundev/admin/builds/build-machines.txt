# Filename: build-machines.txt
#   Author: Shri Amit(amit)
# Synopsis: The following file is used by the instigate-build
#           script to determine:
#             . which machines are to be used at which sites.
#             . the build keywords: all, emu, env, dfmc, libs, tags
#             . the special keywords: Clean, No Report
#           Format in which information must be specified:
#           Site: <SiteName> <Special Keyword> <Special Keyword> ... ...
#           machine1 <Build Keyword> <Build Keyword> ... ...
#           machine2 .. .. ..
#           
#           Build Keywords:
#           all  - Enable all build keywords
#           emu  - Enable the emulator build
#           env  - Enable the environment build
#           dfmc_build - Enable the dfmc build
#           dfmc_image - Enable the dfmc image build
#           libs - Enable the library compilation
#           tags - Enable the TAGS file build
#           byte - Enable a byte compilation of elisp files
#
#           Special Keywords:
#           Clean - Delete fasl files from all dirs specified after
#                   the Clean keyword. If no dirs are specified then
#                   fasls are recursively deleted from ~dylan.
#                   To enable a Clean at all sites, add the keyword
#                   and the dirs as the first line right after these
#                   comments.
#                   example entry: Site: long Clean dfmc duim
#                                  Clean dfmc duim (for all sites)
#                   This will delete all fasl files under ~dylan/dfmc and
#                   ~dylan/duim.
#           No Report - disable the build report sent by instigate-build
#                   after the builds are completed.
#                   example entry: Site: 1cc No Report
#
# TAGS note: TAGS file builds should only be run on a sparc machine as
#            nightly-tag-file uses the gema utility which has currently
#            been built only for sparc platforms.
#
# 29 Jan 98: All environment builds in the emulator discontinued.
#            Used to be done at banshee, bakura, skookum, lordosis
