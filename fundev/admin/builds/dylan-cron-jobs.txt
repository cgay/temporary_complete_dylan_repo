# Synopsis: The following file is parsed by schedule-cron
#           script to determine the cron jobs to be submitted.
#           These entries must be in the format:
#             hostname  cron entry
#           Note that entries for each site must contain an
#           entry for instigate builds for the nightly builds
#           to happen.
# Revision: By: amit. On: Dec 05 1996. Rea: New file to replace
#           the old site specific dylan-cron-jobs.<site>
