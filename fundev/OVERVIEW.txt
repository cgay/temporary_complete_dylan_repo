                         ============================
                            OPEN DYLAN SOURCE CODE
                         CONVENTIONS AND ORGANIZATION
                         ============================

========================
Acronyms and Definitions
========================

CG   - 
MPS  - A memory management system. When using a HARP back-end, MPS manages
       garbage collection. When using a C back-end, the Boehm GC library
       manages garbage collection.
DFM  - Dylan Flow Machine.
DFMC - 
HARP - Harlequin Abstract RISC Processor. An artificial assembly language.
       HARP code is transformed into the target processor's actual assembly
       language. The other back-ends are Java byte-code and C.
RTG  - 
DOOD - File-based object-oriented database.
DOSS - Dylan object serialization format.


========================
Platforms and Registries
========================

A platform is a combination of CPU and OS. Dylan-only code is platform
independent, but calling specific OS functions or specifying a library for the
linker introduces a platform dependency.

A platform-specific Dylan library is created through a platform-specific LID
file. The association between LID file and platform is created through files
in "sources/registry" directory. The files will contain a single line that
indicates the LID file for that library on that platform. The location of the
LID file is given relative to the "sources" directory.

The LID file will be in the source-code directory corresponding to that
library. There will be several LID files in that directory, with names that
indicate what platforms each applies to.


==================
Naming Conventions
==================

OD uses the following special character prefixes to indicate different things:

%name - An internal name.
&name - A model class. It models a run-time value at compile time.
^name - A compile-time computation on run-time values via a model class.


======================
Commenting Conventions
======================

"///"    - Documentation of a function, macro, etc.
"---"    - Interim solution or questionable code.
"---***" - Serious concerns or bug work-arounds.

===========
Directories
===========

The directory structure doesn't provide enough context to say which file is
used where, so I've attempted to catalog each directory's purpose myself.

----------
Registries
----------

These files are installed as part of an Open Dylan release, and indicate what
libraries go together and how a library should be built for a specific
platform.

sources
  Library-Packs
  registry
    generic             - This code is platform-independent.
    ...                 - Each platform gets its own directory. Platforms are
                          named for their processor and operating system.

These may or may not be used or useful, but either I haven't looked at them,
or I don't know what they do, or I don't know how to properly describe them.
