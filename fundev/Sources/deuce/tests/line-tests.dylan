Things to test ...

line-{next,previous}[-setter]
line-section[-setter]
line-bps[-setter]
line[-contents]-properties[-setter]
line-modification-tick[-setter]
  [Not worth testing for <basic-line> -- they're just slots.]

note-line-changed
  Check propagation of change information.

line-read-only?[-setter]
  Check setting and getting, for different classes of lines.
  Check that modification tick is -1 for read-only lines.

line-length[-setter]
  [Note the use of copy-bytes -- depends on byte-sized characters.]
  Check setting and getting, for increasing and decreasing size;
    include decreasing to 0.

line-contents[-setter]
  Check setting and getting; check contents and length are \= to those
    for the value it was set to.

line-empty?
  Check for different classes of <line>.
  Check for newly-created lines and for lines which have had contents
    added and removed. 

copy-line
  Check for each class of line.
  ---*** Check that contents "shrink" when copied, if length is less
    than real length of contents.

methods on dump-line
    (for <[rich-]text-line>, <[structural-]diagram-line>)
  Dump to a <string-stream> [can we?] and test for \= to an example.
  Method for <diagram-line> should error.
  [Method for <rich-text-line> does nothing for now.]

methods on do-characters
    (for <text-line>, <[structural-]diagram-line>)
  [For <text-line> could use "for (i from _start to _end by _step)"?]
  Check using function with observable effects.
  Check with empty and non-empty strings.

methods on as(<string>, ...)
    (for <[rich-]text-line>, <diagram-line>)
  [No real method for <rich-text-line> yet.]
  Compare result to existing <string> with \=.  Check with empty and
    non-empty strings.
