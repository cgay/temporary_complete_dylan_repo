* Disclaimer

This release constitutes a work in progress.  Not everything in the
code is in its final form.  Where possible, we have flagged "hot"
items with comments starting with "//---***".

In particular, this example documentation is completely unfinished.


* Tutorial

First, load the library 'interface-builder' and then call the function
test-interface-builder().  To build an interface, use the menu item
File>New to create a new interface, and then select an object in the
list and press the add button to add a child to it or press remove to
remove the object. As a first attempt, try the following sequence:

   File>New
   Add>Column Layout
   Add>Text Field
   Add>Text Field
   Add>Row Layout
   Add>Text Field
   Add>Text Field
