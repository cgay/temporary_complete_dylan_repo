<H2>sample-ole-server library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that demonstrates use of the
low-level OLE interface to create a graphical object that can be embedded
in compound documents.</P>

<P>See the Functional Developer "OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual for
documentation of the <b>OLE</b> library which the program uses.<P>

<P>The example was translated to Dylan from a C++ program in directory
"\MSTOOLS\samples\ole\simpsvr\" from the Microsoft Win32 SDK of July
1995. The "README.TXT" file there describes it as:</P>

   <BLOCKQUOTE>
    This sample is the simplest OLE 2.0 object that can be written and
    still support the visual editing feature.  The object that this server
    supports is a colored square with a black border.
   </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This example intentionally maintains the style of the original C++
version, and uses the same low-level OLE and user interface APIs as
the C++ program.  See the example project <b>win32-ole-server</b> for
an implementation of the same functionality using the higher-level
server framework provided by Functional Developer.</P>

<H3>Program internals</H3>

<P>Program execution begins in file <em>last.dylan</em>, which calls
<code>WinMain</code> in <em>simpsvr.dylan</em>, which contains the
Windows event loop.  That same file contains function
<code>main-wnd-proc</code> which handles Windows events.  The actual
drawing of the picture is done by function <code>Draw</code> in
<em>obj.dylan</em>.  Note also the initialization function
<code>fInitInstance</code> in <em>app.dylan</em>, which, when the
program is invoked embedded, registers a Class Factory object, which
the container application uses to obtain the handles used to
manipulate the object.</P>

<H3>Server registration and invocation</H3>

<P>After building the program, you will have a file called
<em>sample-ole-server.exe</em> which you can execute.  By itself,
it doesn't do much very interesting -- just draws a square whose color
you can select from a menu.</P>

<P>The really interesting thing is using the program as an embedded
object invoked by a client. But first, in order for the server to work
when invoked from a client program, all of the libraries used by your
server need to either be in the same directory as the server file, or
else in a directory which is in the system PATH (not the individual
user's PATH on NT). The simplest way to accomplish this is to use the
"Project &gt; Build Release" command to create a release directory. If
you wish, you can move that directory to any location you want, but you
must do so before you attempt to register the server.</P>

<P>Next, the server must be registered with the operating system.  To do that,
edit the file <em>sample.reg</em> to replace the three pathnames in there
with the actual pathname where your <em>sample-ole-server.exe</em> resides.  It
has to have a full pathname.  Then the actual registration is done by
entering the following at a DOS command prompt:</P>

	<blockquote><code>regedit /s sample.reg</code></blockquote>

<P>Now you can use any OLE container program, such as Microsoft Write or
WordPad, or the sample container application "simpcntr" in the SDK, to
choose the "Dylan simple OLE server" object from the "Insert Object"
command of the "Edit" menu or the "Object" command of the "Insert" menu,
depending on the program.  The program will then be invoked to draw its
picture which will then appear in the compound document.</P>

<P>Note that the object title as displayed in the "Insert Object"
dialog comes from the second line of the <em>sample.reg</em> file, and
that the Class ID used in the registration has to match the call to
<code>make-GUID</code> at the top of file <em>app.dylan</em>.  The Dylan
version has been given a different Class ID from that used by the
original C++ version to enable both to be installed without
conflicting.</P>

<P>The SDK sample container uses in-place activation, in which the picture is
drawn directly in the window of the container program, and the menu for
changing the color is added to the container's menu bar.  However, "Write"
first invokes the program in its own window, and then when you select "File
-> Exit", the picture will be copied into the document in Write.  So the
two containers exercise different parts of this server program.</P>
