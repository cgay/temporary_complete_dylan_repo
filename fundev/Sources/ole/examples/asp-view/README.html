<H2>ASP-view component</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that is a demonstration of
a WWW server-side Automation component using the Microsoft Active Server Pages
(ASP) protocols.  It also demonstrates the use of type libraries
in a Dylan project.</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-Automation</b> library used by this program is documented in
the Functional Developer "OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<H3>Web Server configuration</H3>

<P>In order to use this example, you must have a Web server that supports
Active Server Pages, such as 
 <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/iis/default.asp">Windows NT Internet
Information Server (IIS)</A>, or a <A
HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/officedev/office/html/settinguppersonalwebserver.htm">Microsoft
personal Web server</A>.  Make sure to install the Active Server Pages
component of the Web server by downloading any additional Setup programs
needed.</P>

<P>Once you have a server installed, copy the file <em>asp-view.asp</em> from
this project's source directory to a directory used by the server (e.g.
to <em>c:\inetpub\wwwroot</em> or <em>c:\wwwroot\</em>).</P>

<H3>Project configuration</H3>

<P>This project uses the Automation type library defined by the
Web server.  Before you can compile the project, you must update it
to know the location of the type library on your system:</P>

<ol>
<li>First, find your Web server's <em>asp.dll</em> file.  Typically
it will be in <em>c:\windows\system\inetsrv\asp.dll</em> or
<em>c:\winnt\system32\inetsrv\asp.dll</em>.  If you cannot access the Web
server files directly from your development machine, just put a copy
of <em>asp.dll</em> anywhere where it will be accessible -- the file is only
used to extract type information, it will not be actually executed by this
project.
<li>In the Sources tab of the Project window, open the file
<em>asp-type-library.spec</em> (the last file in the project) by
double-clicking on it.
<li>Edit the "Type-library:" line to contain the actual location of
the <em>asp.dll</em> file.
</ol>

<P>You can now build the component, e.g. by pressing the "Build" button
in the Project window.</P>

<H3>Component registration</H3>

<P>In order for the component to work when started by the Web server,
all of the libraries used by the component need to either be in the same
directory as the component, or else in a directory which is in
the system PATH (not the individual user's PATH on NT). The simplest
way to accomplish this is to use the "Project &gt; Build Release"
command to create a release directory. If you wish, you can move that
directory to any location you want, but you must do so before you
attempt to register the component.  If your Web server is on a different
machine than the project, you must copy the release directory
to the Web server's machine and register it there, since this is a
server-side component.</P>

<P>To register the component, use the <code>regsvr32</code> command
line utility like this:</P>

 <blockquote><code>regsvr32 asp-view.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>(The complete pathname will need to be given if the file is in a
different directory that is not in the PATH.)  This will cause the
appropriate entries to be made in the Windows System Registry. (For
use in a batch script, the "<code>/s</code>" option may be used to suppress the
dialog box reporting completion.) The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:</P>

 <blockquote><code>regsvr32 /u asp-view.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>This invokes the server to unregister itself, so won't work
if the server has been deleted first.</P>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<P>To test out the component, use any browser to connect to your Web server,
and ask it to load the <em>asp-view.asp</em> file.  E.g. if you installed
<em>asp-view.asp</em> in the server's top-level <em>wwwroot</em> directory,
and the browser is running on the same host as the server, the url would look
like this: <code>http://localserver/asp-view.asp</code>

<P>The resulting page will give you the option of viewing different aspects
of the Active Server Pages environment, such as the values of all server
variables or the session id.  The asp-view component is invoked to compute
and display the requested information back on the page.</P>
