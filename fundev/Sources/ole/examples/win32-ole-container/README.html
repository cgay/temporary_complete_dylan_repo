<H2>win32-ole-container library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program which demonstrates use of the
Functional Developer's <b>ole-container</b> library to support embedding of
graphical OLE objects produced by other programs.</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-Container</b> library is documented in the Functional Developer
"OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<P>This example provides the same simple functionality as the
<b>sample-ole-container</b> example under the "Low-level OLE"
examples, which uses the low-level Windows OLE API directly.  This
example uses the framework provided by the <b>OLE-Container</b>
library to simplify the program.  It uses the low-level Win32 API for
its user interface.  See also the <b>sample-duim-container</b> project
for an example of a container program which uses <b>DUIM</b> for its
user interface.</P>

<P>This example has the following limitations:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>It has no support for saving state to a file.</LI>
 <LI>It only supports one embedded object at a time.</LI>
 <LI>It supports only the basic OLE compound document protocols, not any
   of the newer optional ActiveX features.</LI>
 <LI>The embedded object cannot be moved or resized.</LI>
</UL> 

<P>Program execution begins in <code>main-program</code> in
<em>main.dylan</em>, which contains the Windows event loop.  The file
<em>windows.dylan</em> contains the function
<code>main-wnd-proc</code>, which handles Windows events.  When the
"Insert Object" command is invoked from the "Edit" menu, the function
<code>insert-object</code> in the file <em>appdoc.dylan</em> calls
<code>insert-object-from-dialog</code> from the <b>ole-container</b>
library to handle choosing and connecting to an object.</P>

<P>After building the program, run it and use the "Insert Object" command
from the "Edit" menu to choose an object from among those registered on
your system.  Some may directly draw in the container window, while
others pop up a separate application window in which you create the
object, which is inserted in the container when you exit the
application.  Some objects add their own commands to the menu bar.
Click outside the object to de-activate it; double click on it to
re-activate.  You can invoke "New" from the "File" menu to erase the
current object and enable selecting another.</P>
