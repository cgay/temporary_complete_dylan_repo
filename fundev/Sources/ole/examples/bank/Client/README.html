<H2>OLE Bank-Client</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">


<P>This project contains an example program that demonstrates the use of
custom COM interfaces in Functional Developer.  It is the
client part of the <A HREF="../README.html">OLE Bank Client/Server
example</A>.  It uses the Functional Developer <b>COM</b> library to access
the Windows COM functionality.  It uses the <b>DUIM</b> library for its
user interface.</P>

<P>The <b>COM</b> library is documented in the Functional Developer
"OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<H3>Building and Testing the Application</H2>

<P>Before you can run this example, you must first build and register the
bank server, as described in the <A HREF="../Server/README.html">server
README</A> file.</P>

<P>Then to build the client, open the <b>bank-client</b> project and
press the "Build" buttons on the respective Project Windows.</P>

<P>Now, start the client by selecting "Project&gt;Start" or pressing the
"Start/Resume" button in the tool bar on the Project Window.  The client
will first start the server, which will connect to the database and then
show its GUI (a status window titled "Bank Server").  Once the server
is running, the client will present its GUI (a window titled "Bank Client")
and await your commands.</P>

<P>Now you can issue commands from the Bank Client window, such as
"Open New Account..." from the "Bank" menu.  You can issue commands which
modify the selected account from the "Account" menu.</P>

<P>In the server, you can check the "Active Log" box to monitor requests
from the client.</P>

<H3>Program Internals</H3>

<P>The client application is composed of the following parts:
<DL>
<DT><em>client-library.dylan</em>
   <DD>library and module definitions.
<DT><em>client.dylan</em>
   <DD>client COM interfaces access routines
<DT><em>client-frame.dylan</em>
   <DD>client GUI
<DT><em>server-main.dylan</em>
   <DD>client initialization and main entry point.
<DT><em>project bank-interface</em>
   <DD>A subproject containing the definitions of all the COM interfaces
   used in this example. Since the server is written in Dylan, we simply
  use the same library the server used to define the protocol.
  (If the server hadn't been written in Dylan, we would use a Dylan
   library automatically generated by the New Project wizard's
  "Interface to COM Type Library" support.)
