    <h1>Jam-based Build System</h1>
    <p>This document describes the Jam-based build system for Functional Develoer.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the Functional Developer <code>build-system</code> is to co√∂rdinate the final stages in the building of a Dylan library project. The Functional Developer compiler takes a Dylan library in the form of Dylan source files, and directly generates x86 or PPC machine language object files (in either COFF or ELF format, depending on the target platform). These object files need to be linked together to construct either an executable object fie, or a loadable dynamically-linked library (also called a shared library). This link needs to performed by an external tool such as the Microsoft or GNU linker. The <code>build-system</code> component, controlled by a user-specified script file, directs the execution of these external tools.</p>
    <h2>Why Jam-based?</h2>
    <p>Use of the Jam scripting language increases the flexibility of Functional Developer for users, and makes it more maintainable by removing hard-coded assumptions spread throughout various layers of the compiler. Previous versions of the Functional Developer <code>build-system</code> component permitted users to choose either the Microsoft or GNU Binutils linker on the Win32 platform, and always used the GNU Binutils ELF linker on Linux platforms. New versions of these tools require modifications that go beyond the current flexibility of the <code>build-system</code> component, as will new Functional Developer target platforms.</p>
    <p>Though the logic of <code>build-system</code> (and a former companion library, <code>linker-support</code>) was hard-coded, it did allow a limited amount of parameterization using <q>script</q> files. A typical parameterization, from the Microsoft linker script, looked like this::</p>
    <pre>#
linkdll
link /NODEFAULTLIB /INCREMENTAL:NO /PDB:NONE /NOLOGO /ENTRY:$(mangled-dllname)Dll@12 -debug:full -debugtype:cv /nologo /dll /out:$(full-dll-name) kernel32.lib @$(dllname).link $(objects) $(c-libs) /base:$(base) /version:$(image-version) $(linkopts)
</pre>
    <p>Though these script files were poorly documented and insufficiently flexible, they did inspire the introduction of a <q>real</q> scripting language to direct the final stages of compilation in Functional Developer.</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html">Jam</a> is a build tool designed by Christopher Seiwald, founder of <a href="http://www.perforce.com/">Perforce Software</a>. It is similar in some ways to <code>make</code>, the raditional Unix build tool. However, instead of using only simple declarative rules to define build targets and the dependencies between them, Jam contains a full scripting language, allowing build script authors to define high-level build instructions that match particular applications. The Jam program also includes Jambase, a library of rules (functions) for building exeutables and libraries from C, C++, and Fortran sources.</p>
    <p>The original Jam tool is a standalone program written in C and <acronym>YACC</acronym>. For use in the Functional Developer <code>build-system</code>, Peter Housel re-implemented the Jam language and build logic as a reusable Dylan library.</p>
    <h2>Choosing Jam Build Scripts</h2>
    <p>Normally you can simply use the Jam build script supplied with Functional Developer that corresponds to the external linker you will be using. The pre-supplied build scripts include the following:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <code>x86-win32-vc6-build.jam</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Build script for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>x86-win32-vc7-build.jam</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Build script for Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>x86-win32-mingw-build.jam</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Build script for <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> gcc.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>x86-linux-build.jam</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Build script for x86 Linux systems using gcc.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The default build script is <code><i>platform-name</i>-build.jam</code>. You can select a different build script from the Link page of the Environment Options dialog in the IDE, or using the <code>-build-script</code> option on the console compiler or console environment command-line.</p>
    <p>Jam build scripts are written using the Jam script language, as described in the <a href="http://public.perforce.com/public/jam/src/Jam.html">Jam manual page</a>. Most build scripts <code>include</code> the <code>mini-jambase.jam</code> file, which contains excerpts from the <a href="http://public.perforce.com/public/jam/src/Jambase">
        <code>Jambase</code>
      </a> file included with Perforce Jam and described in the <a href="http://public.perforce.com/public/jam/src/Jambase.html">Jambase Reference</a>. They can also make use of additional built-in rules defined by the Functional Developer build system, as described below.</p>
    <h2>How the Compiler Uses the Build System</h2>
    <p>When you compile a library, the Functional Developer compiler constructs a new <code>build</code> directory and places the generated object files in it. It also constructs a text file called <code>dylanmakefile.mkf</code> to be read by the build system. This file contains information imported from the original LID or HDP project file, as well as information generated during compilation. Here is a sample <code>dylanmakefile.mkf</code>, in this case the one generated for the <code>build-system</code> component itself:</p>

</pre>
    <p>External files are used to communicate with the build system in order for the information to persist between invocations of the compiler. On the Win32 platform, <code>dylanmakefile.mkf</code> files are also copied into the <code>lib</code> directory on installation so that other libraries can link against</p>
    <p>When Functional Developer needs to link a project, it calls the <code>build-system</code>, passing the name of the build directory and a list of targets to be built. The build system reads the <code>dylanmakefile.mkf</code> file and builds the targets accordingly.</p>
    <p>The Functional Developer compiler&apos;s project manager expects the Jam build script to define the following pseudo (<code>NotFile</code>) targets:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <code>exports</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Describe exports.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>unify-dll</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Describe unify-dll.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>dll</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Link the project as a dynamically-linked library.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>unify-exe</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Describe unify-exe.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>exe</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Link the project as an exeutable program.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>release</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Describe release.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>clean-all</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Remove build products in the top-level project, and in all of the non-system libraries that it uses.</dd>
      <dt>
        <code>clean</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>Remove build products in the top-level project.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Automatically-invoked Jam Rules</h2>
    <p>When the build system reads a <code>dylanmakefile.mkf</code> file it invokes several of the Jam rules (functions) defined in the user&apos;s build script.These rules in turn register the necessary targets and their dependencies with the Jam build mechanism.</p>
    <p>All of the rules described below take <i>image</i> as their first parameter; this is a list whose first element is the library name (from the <code>Library:</code> keyword of the <code>.mkf</code> file) and whose optional second component is the base name of the exeutable or shared library (from the <code>Executable:</code> keyword of the <code>.mkf</code> file).</p>
    <h3>DylanLibrary <i>image</i> : <i>version</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Link a Dylan library as a shared library or executable image.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryLinkerOptions <i>image</i> : <i>options</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Add the given options to the link command line of the shared library and executable images. Expanded.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryBaseAddress <i>image</i> : <i>address</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Set the base address of the shared library.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryCLibraries <i>image</i> : <i>libraries</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Link C (or other externally-derived) libraries into the shared library. Expanded.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryCObjects <i>image</i> : <i>objects</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Link C (or other externally-derived) object files into the shared library.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryCSources <i>image</i> : <i>sources</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Link C source files into the shared library.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryCHeaders <i>image</i> : <i>headers</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Do nothing.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryRCFiles <i>image</i> : <i>rcfiles</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Link Win32 resource files into the shared library and executable.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryJamIncludes <i>image</i> : <i>includes</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Not yet implemented.</p>
    <h3>DylanLibraryUses <i>image</i> : <i>library</i> : <i>dir</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Link other Dylan libraries into the shared library.</p>
    <h2>Additional Built-In Jam Rules</h2>
    <p>The build system defines the following additional built-in rules.</p>
    <h3>IncludeMKF <i>includes</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Read each of the given <code>.mkf</code> files and invoke Jam rules as described above.</p>
    <h3>DFMCMangle <i>name</i> ;</h3>
    <p>Mangle the given <i>name</i> according to the Functional Dylan compiler&apos;s mangling rules. If <i>name</i> has a single component, it is considered to be a <q>raw</q> name; if there are three components they correspond to the variable-name, module-name, and library-name respectively.</p>
