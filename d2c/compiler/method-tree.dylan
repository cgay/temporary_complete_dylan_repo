/*
Method Trees:

A next-method tree represents the method ordering of statically orderable
methods.  The static method ordering is computed based only on the compile-time
method specializers, thus it can't describe:
 A] Methods whose ordering depends on the class-precedence list of the actual
    argument.  This rule comes into play only when two class specializers
    intersect, but neither is a subtype of the other.
 B] Methods with specializers whose type is not known at compile time, due to a
    non-constant type expression.

The structure of the tree is a list of sub-nodes.  Method precedence
becomes greater as the tree is descended.  When we reach a leaf
method, we know that no method can have greater precedence than that
method on any call to which the method is applicable.  Each interior
node holds a method and a method tree of the stuff more specific than
that method.

*/


/// Specializer comparison:

/*

For our purposes, there are 6 possible static relations between method
specializers:
 disjoint: no intersection
 >: more specific (a subtype)
 <: less specific (a supertype)
 =: identical
 ambiguous: definitely ambiguous (non-hierarchial non-class types)
 unknown: unknown types or non-hierarchical classes.

The 6 corresponding method orderings occur like this:
 disjoint: definitely disjoint (at least one specializer doesn't intersect)
 >: more specific (all = or subtype)
 <: less specific (all = or supertype)
 =: the same (all =, an error)
 ambiguous: anything combined with either both < and > or any
            single definitely ambiguous position (non-class non-hierarchical.)
 unknown: unknown

For sealed methods, at least one spec would have to be unknown or a
non-hierarchical class for us to end up in the "unknown" bucket.  But even
with such a spec, methods can sometimes be determined to be defintely disjoint
or definitely ambiguous by considering other specializers.
