	===========================================
	Functional Developer Environment To-Do List
	===========================================


High priority
=============

 - Browser:
   - fix history problems, particularly in using the combo box.
   - get typing of object names to work quickly and accurately.

Medium priority
===============

 - Rationalize the compiler warning classifications.

Low priority
============

Future Ideas
============

 - URL-style browser fields

  It seems like it would be really cool if in the browser as you
  inspected down through slots in an object it could display the path
  you'd followed. So, say in the browser you'd double-clicked on a
  slot called gadget, and then double clicked on its sheet-child slot
  and then on the gadget-items slot in the child, the field would
  show:

    gadget.sheet-child.gadget-items

  rather than the current:

    #[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

  i.e. the name would be like a URL address within the scope of the
  debugger, so you can see the path that you followed.

  It is hard to see how to do this in a uniform way for all the kinds of
  objects we'd be browsing, so I don't think we can do it for this
  release. But I do like the idea in concept, and I'll keep thinking
  about how we might be able to do it.
