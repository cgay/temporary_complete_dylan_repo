<H2>Sample-DUIM-container library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that demonstrates use of the
Functional Developer <b>DUIM-OLE-container</b> library to support embedding of
graphical objects produced by other programs. It uses the Functional Developer DUIM
framework for the user interface.</P>

<P>See the Functional Developer "OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference
manual for documentation of the <b>DUIM-OLE-container</b> library which
the program uses.</P>

<P>This example provides approximately the same simple functionality as the
<b>win32-ole-container</b> example which uses the <b>ole-container</b> library
for OLE support and low-level Win32 API for user interface, and
the <b>sample-ole-container</b> example which just uses the low-level OLE API
directly.</P>

<P>This example has the following limitations:</P>
<UL>
 <LI>It has no support for saving state to a file.</LI>
 <LI>It only supports one embedded object at a time.</LI>
 <LI>It supports only the basic OLE compound document protocols, not any
   of the newer optional ActiveX features.</LI>
 <LI>The embedded object cannot be moved or resized.</LI>
 <LI>It doesn't yet update the "Edit" menu by adding a command to activate
   the embedded server.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The program has the same basic structure as any DUIM program; it actually
only uses a few things from the <b>duim-ole-container</b> library:</P>
<UL>
 <LI><code>&lt;container-frame-mixin&gt;</code> is a superclass of the program's frame class.</LI>
 <LI><code>&lt;container-sheet-mixin&gt;</code> is a superclass of the drawing area class.</LI>
 <LI><code>insert-from-dialog</code> is called to implement the insert command.</LI>
</UL>

<P>After building the program, run it and use the "Insert Object" command
from the "Edit" menu to choose an object from among those registered on
your system.  Some may directly draw in the container window, while
others pop up a separate application window in which you create the
object, which is inserted in the container when you exit the
application.  Some objects add their own commands to the menu bar.
Click outside the object to de-activate it; double click on it to
re-activate.  You can invoke "New" from the "File" menu to erase the
current object and enable selecting another.</P>
