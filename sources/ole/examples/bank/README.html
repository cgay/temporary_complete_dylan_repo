<H2>OLE Bank Client/Server</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">


<P>
This is a simple example illustrating the use of custom COM interfaces
to provide the infrastructure of a banking application. This
application is a typical example of a three-tier application
architecture comprising a database access layer, a business logic
layer, and a user interface layer. The application has three components:
<UL>
<LI>A database that provides persistent storage for the accounts managed by the bank.
<LI>A server that represents the bank and provides an object-oriented interface to its accounts.
<LI>A client that provides a graphical user interface to the bank.
</UL>

<P>The <em>database</em> layer consists of a Microsoft Access(tm) relational database.
The server communicates with the database using Functional Developer's <b>sql-odbc</b> library.</P>

<P> The <em>server</em> provides a single COM object that represents
the bank, and a collection of COM objects representing accounts.  The
bank object has operations for opening, closing, and retrieving
accounts from the database.  An account has operations for querying
and updating its balance.  The server uses Functional Developer's
<b>OLE-Automation</b> library to implement dual interfaces for all its
objects, allowing use with both vtable and dispatch interface
clients.</P>

<P> The <em>client</em> contacts the server and presents the user with
a graphical interface to the bank.  Menus are provided to allow the
user to request operations on the bank and selected accounts.  The
client passes the requests on to the server and provides a local
view of account information obtained from the server.  The
client provided here implements vtable access to the server via
Functional Developer's <b>COM</b> library. The user interface is implemented
using the Functional Developer <b>DUIM</b> library.</P>

<P>To try out this application, first see the <A
HREF="Server/README.html">Server README</A> file for instructions on
how to build and configure the server and database layers, and then see
the <A HREF="Client/README.html">Client README</A> file for
instructions on building the client.</P>
