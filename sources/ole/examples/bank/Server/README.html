<H2>OLE Bank-Server</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that demonstrates the use of
dual COM interfaces and database access in Functional Developer.  It is the
server part of the <A HREF="../README.html">OLE Bank Client/Server
example</A>.  It uses the macros and utility functions provided by the
<b>OLE-Automation</b> library, rather than the low-level Windows OLE
API, to define and implement its objects.  It uses the
<b>sql-odbc</b> library to communicate with the database.  And it uses
the <b>DUIM</b> library to provide a simple user interface.</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-Automation</b> and <b>sql-odbc</b> libraries are documented in the Functional Developer
"OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<H3>ODBC requirements</H3>

<P>In order to run this example, you need to have ODBC version 3.0 (or
higher) and an ODBC driver for Microsoft Access installed on the
machine hosting the server application. You do not need a copy of
Microsoft Access.</P>

<P>Both ODBC 3.x and the Microsoft Access driver are available free
for download from the <A
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/data/">Microsoft Universal Data Access
web site</A>.</P>

<P>From the Downloads section, download the Microsoft Data Access
Components, version 1.5c or higher, for your Windows platform. You do
not need to download the full 6.4MB file -- mdacfull.exe, the MDAC
1.5c redistribution setup file, is only 3.4MB and contains everything
you need.</P>

<P>This file installs ODBC 3.x and the Microsoft Access Driver,
amongst other things.</P>

<P>This information may change in the future.</P>

<H3>Registering the Database with ODBC</H3>

<P>This example includes a sample bank database, <em>bankDB.mdb</em>, in
the project directory (typically in <em>C:\Program
Files\Functional Objects\Dylan\Examples\ole\bank\server</em>).  Before we
can access this database using ODBC, we need to register it under a
<i>data source name</i> in the ODBC control panel. This installation
step also tells ODBC which driver to use when connecting to the
database.

<ol>
<li> First, make sure the database is writable: find the
<em>bankDB.mdb</em> file in an Explorer window, right-click on it, select <b>Properties</b> from the pop-up menu, and clear the <b>Readonly</b> attribute if it is checked.
<li> Open the ODBC control panel.
<li> Select the <b>User DSN</b> tab.
<li> Click <b>Add</b>...
<li> Select <b>Microsoft Access Driver</b> from the list of available drivers.
<li> Click <b>Finish</b>.
<li> In the <b>Microsoft Access 97 setup</b> dialog, enter the <b>Data Source Name</b> as "bankDB".
<li> Click <b>Select</b> to bring up a file dialog. Browse until you locate the <em>bankDB.mdb</em> file.
<li> Select <em>bankDB.mbd</em> from the list of available database files.
<li> Click <b>OK</b> to close the file dialog.
<li> Click <b>OK</b> to close the <b>Microsoft Access 97 Setup</b> dialog.
<li> Click <b>OK</b> to close the control panel.
</ol>

<H3>Server registration and invocation</H3>

<P>To build the server, open the <b>bank-server</b> project and press
the "Build" button in the Project window.</P>

<P>This project can be built in either of two configurations.  It can
be built as an EXE file which can then be used as a local server, or
it can be built as a DLL file which can then be used as an in-process
server.  The default is to build an EXE file.  Use the "Target file"
entry in the "Link" tab of the "Project &gt; Settings..." dialog to
switch between these two options.</P>

<P>In either case, in order for the server to work when started from a client program,
all of the libraries used by the server need to either be in the same
directory as the server executable, or else in a directory which is in
the system PATH (not the individual user's PATH on NT). The simplest
way to accomplish this is to use the "Project &gt; Build Release"
command to create a release directory. If you wish, you can move that
directory to any location you want, but you must do so before you
attempt to register the server.</P>

<P>Before you can use the server, you must register it and create its
type library.  How to do this depends on whether you have built a local
(EXE) server or an in-process (DLL) server.</P>

<P>To register a local server, run it from a DOS command prompt
like this:<P>

  <blockquote><code>bank-server.exe /regserver</code></blockquote>

<P>This will make the type library, create the necessary entries in
the Windows System Registry, and then terminate without creating any
windows. The full pathname of the server is recorded, so you must
unregister the server before you move or delete it.  You can
unregister it by doing:</P>

  <blockquote><code>bank-server.exe /unregserver</code></blockquote>

<P>To register an in-process server, use the <code>regsvr32</code> command
line utility like this:</P>

 <blockquote><code>regsvr32 bank-server.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>(The complete pathname will need to be given if the file is in a
different directory that is not in the PATH.)  This will cause the
appropriate entries to be made in the Windows System Registry. (For
use in a batch script, the "<code>/s</code>" option may be used to suppress the
dialog box reporting completion.) The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:</P>

 <blockquote><code>regsvr32 /u bank-server.dll</code></blockquote>

<P>This invokes the server to unregister itself, so won't work
if the server has been deleted first.</P>

<P>After registering the server, you can run the <b>bank-client</b>
example project to test it, as described in the <A
HREF="../Client/README.html">client README</A> file.</P>

<H3>Program Internals</H3>

<P>The server application is composed of the following parts:
<DL>
<DT><em>server-library.dylan</em>
   <DD>library and module definitions.
<DT><em>server.dylan</em>
   <DD>server implementation
<DT><em>database.dylan</em>
   <DD>database support
<DT><em>server-frame.dylan</em>
   <DD>local server GUI
<DT><em>server-main.dylan</em>
   <DD>server initialization and main entry points.
<DT><em>project bank-interface</em>
   <DD>A subproject containing the definitions of all the COM interfaces
   used in this example.  It is a separate project so that it can be shared
   with clients written in Dylan.
