<H2>ole-scribble library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example that demonstrates a program
written using DUIM which can be used as an embedded OLE part.</P>

<P>This example uses the <b>DUIM-OLE-Server</b> library which is
documented in the Functional Developer "OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS"
reference manual.</P>

<P>This is a simple drawing program, where the user can do arbitrary
free-hand line drawing by dragging the mouse.  The file <em>scribble.dylan</em>
has only a couple of modifications from the original non-OLE version
(in the DUIM example <b>scribble</b> in
<em>Examples\duim\scribble\</em>): the scribble frame inherits from
<code>&lt;embeddable-frame&gt;</code> instead of
<code>&lt;simple-frame&gt;</code>, and a couple of calls to
<code>note-embedded-data-changed</code> have been inserted.  The file
<em>run.dylan</em> adds some additional support for use with OLE, as
well as initiating execution.  The file <em>storage.dylan</em>
implements OLE persistent storage for the part.</P>

<P>The program can still be run directly and works the same as the basic
<b>scribble</b> example.  But it can also be registered as an OLE part.</P>

<P>In order for the part to work when invoked from a container
program, all of the libraries used by your part need to either be in
the same directory as the part EXE file, or else in a directory which
is in the system PATH (not the individual user's PATH on NT). The
simplest way to accomplish this is to use the "Project &gt; Build
Release" command to create a release directory. If you wish, you can
move that directory to any location you want, but you must do so
before you attempt to register the part.
</P>

<P>To register the part, run the program (from the release directory) from a DOS command prompt like this:</P>

	<blockquote><code>ole-scribble.exe /regserver</code></blockquote>

<P>This will create the necessary entries in the Windows System Registry and
then terminate without creating any windows. The full pathname of the server
is recorded, so you must unregister the server before you move or delete it.
You can unregister it by doing:
  <blockquote><code>ole-scribble.exe /unregserver</code></blockquote>

<P>Note that even though the complete pathname of the part is recorded
in the registry, some containers (such as Microsoft Write) still
require that it be in a directory on the PATH.</P>

<P>Now you should be able to insert the object into any OLE container program.
For example, from Microsoft Word or WordPad, pull down the "Insert" menu,
select "Object...", and then choose "Dylan DUIM Scribble" from the list in
the dialog box (for "Create New").  The Scribble drawing pane will then be
embedded in the compound document and you can directly draw in it.
Clicking outside of the drawing pane will de-activate it.  Double-clicking
will activate it again.</P>

<P>In Microsoft Write, select "Insert Object..." from the "Edit" menu.  The
application will open as a separate top-level window since Write doesn't
support in-place activation.  When finished drawing, just exit the program
and the image will be copied into the Write document.</P>

<P>The object name as displayed in the "Insert Object" dialog comes
from the <code>object-title:</code> option when making the frame in
the function <code>scribble</code> in <em>run.dylan</em>.</P>
