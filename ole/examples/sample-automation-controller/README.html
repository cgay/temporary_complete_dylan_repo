<H2>Sample-automation-controller library</H2>

<HR ALIGN="CENTER">

<P>This project contains an example program that is a demonstration of a
simple OLE Automation controller in Dylan, using the utility functions of
the Dylan <b>OLE-Automation</b> library rather than the low-level
Windows OLE API. The program issues commands to the companion program in
the project <b>sample-automation-server</b>.</P>

<P>The <b>OLE-Automation</b> library is documented in the Functional Developer
"OLE, COM, ActiveX and DBMS" reference manual.</P>

<P>Before running this program, first either start or register the server
program (see its <em>README</em> file).  Then when the controller is run, it
connects to the server and displays a set of buttons.  Clicking on one of
the buttons causes the indicated action to be performed by the server.
The "Quit" button terminates both programs.</P>
