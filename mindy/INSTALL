	Compilation and installation instructions for Mindy.

Compiling Mindy currently requires the use of an ANSI C compiler.

To configure mindy for your system, simply type ``./configure''
and wait for configure to figure things out.

The default installation path for executables is /usr/local/bin,
for the libraries is /usr/local/lib/mindy.  You can change the
prefix for these paths from /usr/local to whatever by typing
``configure --prefix=whatever''. 

If you want to build mindy in one-place while the sources are
kept in another-place, then type ``cd one-place;
another-place/configure --srcdir=another-place'' and configure will
construct the appropriate directory tree and Makefiles.

Other options may be specified to configure with environment
variables: 

	CC	specifies the c compiler to use
	CCOPTS	specifies options to pass to the c compiler
	YACC	specifies the parser generator
	LEX	specifies the lexer generator
	LFLAGS	specifies the flags passed to LEX

Once you have run configure, you should be able to compile and install
everything by just saying ``make install'' at the top level directory.
If you just want to compile everything without installing it, just say
``make.'' 

The default C compiler options are ``CCOPTS=-g''.  If you're using gcc,
you might try ``CCOPTS="-O4 -finline-functions make -e''.

You can clean up any previously made objects with ``make clean''.
