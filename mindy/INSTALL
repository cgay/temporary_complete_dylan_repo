	Compilation and installation instructions for Mindy.

Compiling Mindy currently requires the use of an ANSI C compiler.  We
highly recommend gcc (GNU CC) if it is available.

To configure Mindy for your system, simply type ``./configure'' and
wait for configure to figure things out.  When that is done, begin the
compilation by typing ``make'' (or ``gmake'' if you have GNU make).
After Mindy has been compiled, type ``make install'' to install it.

The default installation path for executables is /usr/local/bin; for
libraries it is /usr/local/lib/mindy.  You can change the prefix for
these paths from /usr/local to whatever by typing
``configure --prefix=whatever''.  (It is not a good idea to specify the 
path name using a tilda (~) because tilda has a special meaning only 
in csh.  make uses sh, so tildas probably won't do what you want them to)

If you want to build Mindy in one-place while the sources are
kept in another-place, then type ``cd one-place;
another-place/configure --srcdir=another-place'' and configure will
construct the appropriate directory tree and Makefiles.

Other options may be specified to make on the command line:

	CC	specifies the C compiler to use
	CCOPTS	specifies options to pass to the C compiler
	YACC	specifies the parser generator
	LEX	specifies the lexer generator
	LFLAGS	specifies the flags passed to LEX

The default C compiler options (CCOPTS) are ``-g -O4
-finline-functions -Wall'' if you are using gcc, ``-g -O'' otherwise.
If you are not using gcc, we *highly* recommend you read the man page
for your compiler and supply the flags that ask for the maximum
optimization.  (Note that on many compilers, -g, "generate debugging
information", and -O, "optimize", are mutually exclusive.  If you have
to choose between the two, take optimization over debugging
information.)

You can clean up any previously made object files and executables 
with ``make clean''.

Here's what a sample installation might look like:
	./configure --srcdir=/usr/bob/mindy/src --prefix=/usr/bob/mindy
	make CCOPTS="-g -O3"
	make install
This would install binaries to /usr/bob/bin, and library files to
/usr/bob/lib/mindy.
