Mindy/NT runs under Windows/NT v. 3.5 or later.  It requires a file
system that supports long file names (ie HPFS and NTFS, but not FAT).
Mindy/NT requires tar and GNU Zip (gzip) to unpackage.  To run tar you
will need tar.exe and win32gnu.dll.  To run gzip, get gnubin.tar and
use tar.exe to unpackage it.  Install the GNU utilities contained in
gnubin.tar (gzip is one of these utilities).  You can find all of
these files in the same directory you found mindyNT.tar.gz

To install Mindy, unzip the release, change directory to where you
want to install Mindy, and untar it.  This will create a directory
called "mindyNT".  In order to run Mindy, you will need to set the
MINDYPATH environment variable to point to the mindyNT\lib directory.
You may also want to put the mindyNT\bin directory in your PATH.  For
example, if mindyNT.tar.gz is currently in c:\users\fred, and you want
to install it to c:\stuff\mindy-1.3, type the following:

	c:
	cd \users\fred
	gzip -d mindyNT.tar.gz
	cd \stuff
	tar -xvf \users\fred\mindyNT.tar
	set MINDYPATH=c:\stuff\mindyNT\lib
	set PATH=%PATH%;c:\stuff\mindyNT\bin


Mindy/NT comes compiled, but if you want to recompile it, you will
need Microsoft Visual C++ version 2.0 and a make utility named "make"
(Microsoft nmake will work if you rename it).

To recompile Mindy, follow these steps:
	- Fire up Visual C++ by double-clicking on Mindy.mak under the
	  file manager.  Due to a bug in Visual C++ 2.0, you'll have
	  to edit some preprocessor definitions.  Go into the General
	  category of the C/C++ pane of the Project Settings dialog
	  box and fix the preprocessor definitions for each of the
	  Release targets.  In the little window at the bottom,
	  manually remove 

		/D /D /D VERSION=... BINDIR=... LIBDIR=...

	  from the Project Options.  (You'll have to do this once for
	  each of the targets you intend to build)  Then, in the
	  Preprocessor Definitions area, add VERSION=..., BINDIR=...,
	  and LIBDIR=... to the definitions.  Sample values are

		, VERSION="\"1.3\"", BINDIR="\"c:/\"", LIBDIR="\"c:/""

	  (If you define LIBDIR here, you won't need to set the
	  MINDYPATH environment variable.  BINDIR is unused)
	- Select Batch Build under Project.  Check "Compiler Release"
	  and "Interpreter Release".  Select Build.
	- Go back to the command prompt.  Build the libraries by
	  typing

		finish-build "MC=mindydir\Released\mindycomp.exe"

	  where mindydir is the directory you're current in.
	- Install the libraries by typing

		finish-build "INSTALL=copy" "INSTALL_DATA=copy" 
			"LIBDIR=whatever" install

	  (all one line)  You'll need to specify LIBDIR even if you
	  provided it to Visual C++.
	- Install the binaries by typing

		copy Released\mindy.exe bin
		copy Released\mindycomp.exe bin

If you have to modify any of the source files, you'll likely have to
set the write permissions on them:  Go to the file manager, select the
source files, hit Alt-Enter, and clear the Read Only bit.
